# bipartiteSBM-MCMC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/junipertcy/bipartiteSBM-MCMC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/junipertcy/bipartiteSBM-MCMC)

**bipartiteSBM-MCMC** is a MCMC sampler for the degree-corrected bipartite Stochastic Block Model. Three sampling procedures are provided. In `marginalize` and `anneal` mode, the group memberships of each node are found assuming we know the number of communities, (Ka, Kb), of the system. In `estimate` mode, one samples the posterior distribution directly assuming we do not know the number of groups.

It is also used as a submodule for the [det_k_bisbm](https://github.com/junipertcy/det_k_bisbm) library.

## Usage

### Compilation

Depends on `boost::program_options` and `cmake`.

Compilation:

	cmake .
	make

The binaries are built in `bin/`.

### Example marginalization

Example call:

	bin/mcmc -e dataset/southernWomen.edgelist0 -n 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 --membership_path southernWomen_membership.txt -t 1000 -y 18 14 -z 5 5


### Example maximization

In the maximization mode, we guess the planted partition by maximizing the likeihood of the partition (with simulated 
annealing).

The call is similar to that of the marginalization mode:

	bin/mcmc -e dataset/southernWomen.edgelist0 -n 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 --membership_path southernWomen_membership.txt -t 1000 -y 18 14 -z 5 5 --maximize -c exponential

Both the burn-in and sampling frequency are ignored in the maximization mode.

4 cooling schedules are implemented: `exponential`, `linear`, `logarithmic` and `constant`.

There inverse temperature is given as

    beta(t) = 1/T_0 * alpha^(-t)                (Exponential)
    beta(t) = 1/T_0 * [1 - eta * t / T_0]^(-1)  (Linear)
    beta(t) = log(t + d) / c                    (Logarithmic)
    beta(t) = 1 / T_0                           (Constant)

where $t$ is the MCMC step. The paramters of these cooling schedule are passed like so:

	-a T_0 alpha    (Exponential)
	-a T_0 eta      (Linear)
	-a c d          (Logarithmic)
	-a T_0          (Constant)

### Example estimation

    bin/mcmc_history -e dataset/southernWomen.edgelist0 -n 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 -t 1000 -y 18 14 -z 5 5 --estimate -f 10 > blocks.txt
